This is a blazor application, integrated with the ApexCharts JavaScript library.
This application displays two pages showing Line Charts, the first is a page with the library integrated, but no data, and the second is a page with the library prepopulated with some data. Both the pages have a button "Random Data" which when clicked, updates the chart with randomly denerated data.
