This is a blazor application, integrated with the ApexCharts JavaScript library.
This application displays two pages showing Line Charts:
  1 - A page with the library integrated, but no data.
  2 - A page with the library prepopulated with some data,
Both the pages have a button "Random Data" which when clicked, updates the chart with randomly denerated data.
